                     In his philosophy of phenomenology, Husserl elaborates on his understanding of kinaesthetic consciousness not as ‘a consciousness of movement, but a consciousness or subjectivity that is itself characterized in terms of motility, that is, the very ability to move freely and responsively’. Through sensational experience as the interfacing window, the human body becomes the pivot from where the world continuously unfolds itself in-relation-to; this ever-changing relationality becomes the key building material not of one single, but of multiplicity of subjective worlds, all of them self-contained and unique within a mutually shared space of embodied agents. Beyond this infinite swarm of worlds, there is no outside, no absolute truth, no Aleph (the fictional point described by Borges in one of his short stories, from where the world would infinitely reveal itself from all angles at all times). </p>

                 <p class="containerCol">When in the year 1989 Tim Berner-Lee proposed his vision of a ‘global mind’, a shared universal space composed of humans and machines in the form of the World Wide Web at CERN, he drew his inspiration from Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu, a digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing which would facilitate non-sequential writing. The WWW, originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world via a one-directional concept of hypertext, successfully established itself . On the opposite, Nelson’s proposal of a two-directional link system never gained momentum – as an idea it was too far ahead of its time. A small detail leading to an entirely different network architecture: ‘Redefining information not as an index of a past or present event but as the potential for future actions (not what you say but what you could say)’ remains the fundamental inspirational concept for engineers, understanding a network as a set of interactions ‘between sources of signals, in a move that mirrors the turn in design to complexity, process, and connection’. </p>

                 <p class="containerCol">In a common metaphorical understanding, the architecture of a network is described and idealized as de-territorialized, non-hierarchical, flexible and durable. Practices such as internet routing significantly influence the technical modeling of a network’s topology. The network as a highly managed space results from a genealogy of socio-technical negotiations and competing designs, perpetuating biases from the past and present, contributing, amongst others, to the arrival of not the Internet, but ‘just this Internet’. As Eric Snodgrass remarked: <br><br>
                <span class="quote">
                ‘Indeed, key forces in contemporary platform practices, like the establishing of individual user identity, were not necessarily given trajectories in the formation of the Internet as originally conceived. As Wendy Chun highlights, “IP addresses, even when fixed, were not viewed as permanently tethered to a computer, let alone a user” (Chun 2016b, 57). Rather, it was only with the introduction of changes to IP addressing and, even more importantly, via the introduction of techniques like those of HTTP cookies and cross-platform logins, that such a mode of continuous tracking of “unique identifiers” in connected environments became what is now a default and taken for granted practice that undergirds so much of the Internet as it is currently conceived.’
                </span>
                <br><br>
                While a network refers to the concept of connectivity, a platform – a standards-based system ‘that simultaneously distributes interfaces through their remote coordination and centralizes their integrated control through that same coordination’ – can metaphorically be described as a multi-layered skin which manages the underlying network structures. APIs, network sockets, but also airport hubs or Amazon distribution centers are all semipermeable planes that regulate and mediate flows between the platform’s intestines and an exterior world while reinforcing the notion of an inside and outside in this very moment of exchange. Any element of a network’s deep internal organs, its databases, functions, features, and procedures are concealed, rendered irrelevant or even inexistent to the exterior world: what remains is only a black box of inputs and outputs, begging to be touched, ‘to be interfaced’. Compatibility is the necessary precondition ensuring a continuous network ecosystem: Type A plugs grant access to the American electricity grid, in opposition to their European equivalents that will find it a hard nut to crack due to their deviant physical designs. Who- or whatever ignores to obey the entrance criteria to these infrastructures, violating, neglecting or disrupting them, is punished with exclusion, invisibility, anonymity – or no electricity. But what if these grey zones are less vulnerable as they seem? What if these abandoned, non-conforming entities mess up with the inputs and outputs and therefore also with the black box in between? What type of pixelated hallucinations or spawning emancipatory interactions could they produce? Before returning to this question, I will dig into the terminology and taxonomy of addressing systems, as they will serve as our common point of departure.

                    I enter the small room of the Panamerican Kitchen. It is already quite late, the kitchen is about to close. A cloud of metallic fat is hanging in the air; fat they only use for Panamerican food when the vegan delivery had a shortage.                 You immediately caught my attention. You are sitting at a small plastic table, a glass of cheap scotch and a plate with left-over heads of sucked king prawns in front of you. You are slightly bending over the table. In a permanent back and forth you are fighting with wisps of your long blond hair that permanently keep falling into your face. Push back. Fall. Push back. Fall.                 I like the graceful rhythmic movements of your fingers fondling the glass panel of your smartphone. You seem to be far away. I make a step towards you.                 [11:46:20 pm]: "Nice pic."                 [11:47:33 pm]: "Intriguing romantic eyes.. sweet clever deep... submissive but independent. A kinky mind behind those eyes. I tried to describe part of your erotic shade you have in that picture."             You giggle. Your teeth are straight. Something unusual in this city. Your hair caresses your cleavage. I think I love you.                 [11:41:06 pm]: "Nice smile, hair and height. You look warm and positive How are you today?"                 Toilet flushing. Light flashing.                 You don't look up. Instead your hair continues seesawing back and forth. The movement of your fingers changed. Now your thumb rhythmically wipes the screen from right to left, right to left, right to left. Then left to right. And then again right to left, right to left, right to left... You are incredibly fast. Then you switch back to an irregular pattern.             I observe you for a while. The room is empty. Besides both of us all the other guests have left already. The waiter polishes wine glasses with a holey kitchen towel.                 I position myself closer to you. This will crop away my unattractive parts from your field of vision. My way too skinny legs. My bad taste. I twist my head a bit to create the right incidental angle for the light in this room to sculpt the most beautiful parts out of my face while hiding the ugly scar on my left cheek in shadow. I come intensely close.             [11:58:20 pm] "Hey, thought I'd try a question to break the ice. If you could travel to any country in the world, where would you go and why?"                 You don't look up. No response. No reaction on my inept advance. I start to panic. I like animals, but unfortunately animals are not allowed in the Panamerican Kitchen. You could otherwise see kittens balancing on my head, dogs licking my face, or me cuddling an ostrich. I know that everyone else is doing that. It's cute. You might have liked it.                 I open my business case. I am a journalist. You can see me on Aljazeera. I have a degree from Cambridge. Here, I am also on youtube. I will send you the links later. I want to meet you.                 I close it again. You seem to be absorbed in finger movement.                 [11:42:08 pm] "laters, James"                 [11:55:44 pm] "Michael (American)"                 [11:45:39 pm] "xoxoxo Jason"                 I leave the Panamerican Kitchen. </p>
